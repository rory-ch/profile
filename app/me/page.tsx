              I do code for fun but I also like other things! I like camping,
              running, hiking, and generally being outdoors. Travelling is when
              I feel most alive. I am a Los Angeles native but I speak ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º
              Russian fluently. Guess which language I have an accent in?
