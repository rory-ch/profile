            I do code for fun but I also like other things! I like camping,
            running, hiking, and generally being outdoors. Travelling is when I
            feel most alive. I am a Los Angeles native but I speak ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º Russian
            fluently. Guess which language I have an accent in?
