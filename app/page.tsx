            <em>üìÖ Dec 2020 - Apr 2021</em>
            <Paragraph>
              I personally built the public facing web page for scheduling
              COVID-19 vaccinations for the County of Los Angeles, which, at its
              peak, received <Highlight>264 thousand views per day</Highlight>.{" "}
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              This project is the one I am most proud of. My team operated under
              very tight deadlines with rapidly changing requirements. We had
              heavy pressure from the mayor and from county residents who after
              a year of the pandemic, were bursting with anticipation to get
              vaccinated. This was a very important lesson in scaling and
              managing user traffic which I will never forget.

            <em>üìÖ Jan 2023 - Dec 2023</em>
            <Paragraph>
              With close collaboration with design, product, data science, and
              engineering teams, I built what is now the company's primary visit
              scheduling flow. Features include clinic and time selection,
              account creation, logging in, drop-off email flow, family member
              selection, cancelling, and rescheduling.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              This flow is responsible for almost all of the company's
              user-initiated visit scheduling.
